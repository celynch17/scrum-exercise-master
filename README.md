# Swipey Beer Plan
Array of beers = ["beer1", "beer2"]

1st element in array is always beer shown.
When Mouseover event:
    1) put first beer last in array
    2) Slide out first beer
    3) Update the html element
    4) Slide in the next beer
    
Animations to do: I'm moving the beer 300% - probably won't go all the way off the screen on larger screen sizes. Need to look into.
